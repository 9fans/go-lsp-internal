This repo contains (auto-generated) LSP protocol definitions copied from
[gopls internal packages](https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls/internal/lsp/protocol).
It integrates with the
[sourcegraph jsonrpc2 package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sourcegraph/jsonrpc2)
instead of the internal one used by gopls.
